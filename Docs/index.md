SlicerSALT is an open-source, free comprehensive software that will allow 
biomedical scientists to precisely locate shape changes in their imaging studies.

This software called Slicer Shape AnaLysis Toolbox (SlicerSALT), will enhance the 
intuitiveness and ease of use for such studies, as well as allow researchers to 
find shape changes with higher statistical power. Altogether this constitutes a 
crucial resource for the imaging field that will enable many and important new 
findings in biomedical imaging studies.
